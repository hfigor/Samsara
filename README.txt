The Model:

In Samsara, a profile is the model that encapsulates the settings for a meditation session. A profile contains one or more segments, such as a warm-up and a cool-down segment. A segment has one or more sounds associated with it, for example, a sound for the start of the segment and one for the end of the segment.
